### Modifications by [rasi](https://github.com/rasi)

This is a fork of the HTSeq code from its [Sourceforge repo](http://sourceforge.net/projects/htseq/) owned by [Simon Anders](https://www.fimm.fi/en/research/groups/anders).

For instructions, see:

   http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/

To make changes to the Python code, change code in the `HTSeq` folder.

Once you are happy with the changes, run:
```bash
./build_it
```

This will generate the build directory.
